<p class="bgrnd_clr">Homer Jay Simpson (born May 12, 1956)[40] is a man from Springfield. He is the spouse of Marge Simpson and father of Bart, Lisa and Maggie Simpson. Homer is overweight (said to be 239 pounds)[41], lazy, and often ignorant to the world around him. Although he has many flaws, he has shown to have great caring, love, and even bravery to those he cares about and, sometimes, even others he doesn't.</p>
